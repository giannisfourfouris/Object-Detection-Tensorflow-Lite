# TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Android
### Overview
This is a camera app that continuously detects the objects (bounding boxes and classes) in the frames seen by your device's back camera, using our own trained model using Transfer Learning technique from ssd_mobilenet_v2_quantized_coco (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md).
